### Exit Status Codes

- :tada: 0: Success
- :dizzy_face: 1: Generic Error
- :cold_sweat: 3: Input diff is empty
- :cop: 4: Value of `--hwt | --htmlWrapperTemplate` is not a valid file

### Custom HTML wrapper template

The template is a very based on a simple replace of several placeholders as coded
https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html-cli/blob/master/src/cli.ts#L40

To provide a custom template you need to make sure you have the following comments and imports in your HTML, exactly as
they are here:

- Inside the `<head>` tag

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.9.0/styles/github.min.css" />
<!--diff2html-css-->
<!--diff2html-js-ui-->
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const targetElement = document.getElementById('diff');
    const diff2htmlUi = new Diff2HtmlUI(targetElement);
    //diff2html-fileListToggle
    //diff2html-synchronisedScroll
    //diff2html-highlightCode
  });
</script>
```

- Inside the `<body>` tag

```html
<div id="diff">
  <!--diff2html-diff-->
</div>
```

### Examples

`diff2html -s line -f html -d word -i command -o preview -- -M HEAD~1`

- diff last commit, line by line, word comparison between lines, previewed in the browser and input from git diff
  command

`diff2html -i file -- my-file-diff.diff`

- reading the input from a file

`diff -u file1.txt file2.txt | diff2html -i stdin`

- reading diff from stdin

`diff2html -f json -o stdout -- -M HEAD~1`

- print json format to stdout

`diff2html -F my-pretty-diff.html -- -M HEAD~1`

- print to file

`diff2html -F my-pretty-diff.html --hwt my-custom-template.html -- -M HEAD~1`

- print to file using custom markup templates can include the following variables

`diff2html --ig package-lock.json --ig yarn.lock`

- Ignore `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` from the generated diff

_NOTE_: notice the `--` in the examples
